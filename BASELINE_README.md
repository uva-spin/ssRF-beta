# Spin-1 real-time ss-RF simulator with a Voigt burn-rate profile

This package extends the previously validated physical-`R`-bin simulator by replacing the ideal one-bin RF selector with an **adjustable Voigt transition-rate profile**.  The established population state, analytic Pake-doublet lineshape, DNP source, population-dependent diffusion kernel, direct/mirror population bookkeeping, and two-plot PyQt interface are retained.

The key modeling rule is:

```text
The Voigt function is the spatially sampled RF rate field.
It is not a hole subtracted from the displayed spectrum.
```

Every bin evolves through the full three-level population rate equations.  The direct holes, mirror responses, finite-power saturation, diffusion refill, DNP competition, and long-time line shape therefore emerge from the populations.

## RF-rate model

For packet `k`, the `+ <-> 0` transition is observed at physical frequency `R = x[k]`, while the same packet's `0 <-> -` transition is observed at `R = -x[k]`.  A single RF source centered at `R_b` produces one common physical profile

```text
v(R - R_b; Gaussian FWHM, Lorentzian FWHM).
```

The continuous Voigt is integrated over every finite simulation bin:

```text
vbar[j] = (1/dR) integral_bin_j v(R-R_b) dR.
```

The per-packet equalization rates are

```text
Gamma_plus[k]  = Gamma_RF * w[k] * vbar(x[k]-R_b)
Gamma_minus[k] = Gamma_RF * w[k] * vbar(-x[k]-R_b)
```

where `w[k]` is the pre-existing optional Pake-density/coupling factor.  Both branches see the same physical RF field; they sample it at their own transition frequencies.

The RF contribution is calculated directly from all three populations:

```text
dn_plus/dt  = -Gamma_plus  (n_plus-n_zero)
dn_zero/dt  = +Gamma_plus  (n_plus-n_zero)
              -Gamma_minus (n_zero-n_minus)
dn_minus/dt = +Gamma_minus (n_zero-n_minus)
```

No direct-hole/mirror-area rule is used in the runtime model.  In an isolated narrow-bin RF test, the familiar one-half mirror relation appears algebraically as a limiting result of these equations.  With a finite Voigt profile, both transitions of a packet may be driven at once, and diffusion, DNP, and `T1` may act simultaneously, so the observed response is whatever the coupled ODEs predict.

## Voigt parameters

The GUI exposes:

| Control | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `physical R` | RF carrier center in dimensionless physical `R`. |
| `common Gamma_RF` | Common center equalization-rate scale. |
| `Gaussian FWHM dR` | Inhomogeneous/generator-smearing part of the RF rate profile. |
| `Lorentzian FWHM dR` | Homogeneous/power-broadening part of the RF rate profile. |
| `Gamma_RF meaning` | Either normalize the strongest finite-bin average to one or retain the continuous profile's peak normalization. |

Two profile normalizations are available:

- **strongest bin** (`center_bin`, default): the maximum bin-averaged profile value is one.  `Gamma_RF` is therefore the strongest bin-averaged equalization scale and remains intuitive as bin count changes.
- **continuous peak** (`continuous_peak`): the underlying continuous Voigt has `V(0)=1`.  This is useful for grid-convergence and hardware-profile studies; the finite center-bin average may be below one if the profile is narrower than a bin.

Setting both RF FWHM values to zero restores the exact previous one-bin RF operator.  A stored regression test confirms that the old RF trajectory is reproduced to machine precision in this limit.

The top plot displays the normalized Voigt rate profile on a secondary axis.  This overlay is diagnostic only; the spectrum itself is reconstructed from the evolving populations.

## Do not confuse the three widths

The software now contains three independent spectral widths:

1. `line_gamma`: broadening in the static analytic Pake-doublet reference line;
2. `rf_gaussian_fwhm_R` and `rf_lorentzian_fwhm_R`: the applied ss-RF rate profile;
3. `zq_width_R`: the zero-quantum spectral-overlap width in the diffusion kernel.

They may be related by the apparatus and material, but they are not interchangeable parameters and should be calibrated separately.

## Finite-power behavior

The imposed **rate profile** remains Voigt, but the resulting hole generally does not.  For a shallow, RF-only burn, the initial change approximately follows the local Voigt rate multiplied by the pre-burn line intensity.  At longer times, the center saturates before the wings.  Diffusion and DNP further reshape the feature.  This is intentional and is a central advantage of applying the profile to the rate equations rather than subtracting a prescribed Voigt hole.

## Preserved population-dependent spin diffusion

The recovery operator remains the physically constrained packet-pair model from the previous working package.  For example,

```text
J_plus(i,j) = K(i,j) [p0(i) p+(j) - p+(i) p0(j)]
J_minus(i,j)= K(i,j) [p-(i) p0(j) - p0(i) p-(j)]
```

with packet capacity, zero-quantum spectral overlap, and optional orientation correlation in `K(i,j)`.  Internal diffusion conserves total vector polarization, while RF is a vector-polarization sink and DNP is an external source.

## DNP and T1

DNP still drives each packet toward the user-selected signed saturation polarization.  It may operate simultaneously with the finite-width RF profile and diffusion.  `T1` remains an optional independent relaxation toward `P_eq`.

## Recommended calibration sequence

1. Fit the unmanipulated analytic Pake line (`line_gamma`, asymmetry, display scale).
2. Turn diffusion, DNP, and `T1` off and measure shallow short burns at several RF centers.
3. Fit the Gaussian and Lorentzian RF widths to the initial spectral derivative or very short-time hole.
4. Calibrate `Gamma_RF` from the central short-time depletion rate.
5. Increase burn time to test power broadening and center saturation.
6. Re-enable diffusion and fit `K0` and `zq_width_R` to post-burn recovery.
7. Re-enable DNP and fit the DNP source and microwave-dependent diffusion factor.

The RF profile should ultimately be fitted to data obtained with the actual burn coil, matching network, generator, amplifier, and target material.

## Run the GUI

```bash
cd spin1_ssrf_realtime_voigt_burn
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
python3 run_app.py
```

On Windows:

```text
.venv\Scripts\activate
```

The GUI tries PyQt6, PySide6, and PyQt5 in that order.

## Tests and headless validation

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
pytest -q
MPLBACKEND=Agg python3 examples/headless_demo.py
```

The test suite verifies:

- exact previous RF behavior when both Voigt widths are zero;
- one common physical profile for both absorption branches;
- finite-bin integration of the Voigt profile;
- packet-population conservation under RF;
- the complete three-level RF ODE;
- absence of a hard-coded mirror-response ratio for a broad profile;
- faster center depletion than wing depletion;
- grid convergence of the continuous-peak profile integral;
- all prior diffusion, DNP, signed-polarization, and conservation tests.

## Implementation notes

- Exact Voigt evaluation uses `scipy.special.voigt_profile`.
- A normalized pseudo-Voigt fallback is provided for environments without SciPy.
- Gauss-Legendre quadrature averages the profile over each finite `R` bin.
- Profile arrays are cached and automatically invalidated when center, widths, normalization, or grid settings change.
- The explicit Euler integrator still requires conservative choices of `dt` when `Gamma_RF`, diffusion, or DNP rates are large.

## Diagnosing a mirror peak that grows and then fades

The mirror intensity is never assigned from a fixed area rule.  It is generated
by the three-level population equations.  With diffusion enabled, however, the
RF source and the spin-diffusion sink act at the same time.  A local mirror peak
can therefore rise initially, reach a maximum, and then decay toward a driven
steady state even while the direct hole remains visible under continuous RF.

The original Voigt package used `K0 = 50` as an uncalibrated demonstration
value.  At that setting, recovery can nearly cancel the mirror source within a
few tenths of a simulation time unit.  This revision uses a more modest default
`K0 = 5` and adds a **DIFFUSION ON/OFF** button.  For an RF-only check, turn DNP
and diffusion off.  The live readout now reports the RF, diffusion, and net
slopes of both mirror components, so the turnover is directly visible rather
than looking like a sign or plotting error.

`K0` and the zero-quantum width remain material parameters that must be fitted
to measured position-resolved recovery data.
